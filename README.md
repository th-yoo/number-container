# number-container

This is the example used by [Lit Labs: Context](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irHAr1yTE5Q) to introduce [@lit/context](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lit/context).

* The current stable version of **@lit/context** is used.

* Bonus: I implemented also another number-container with [@shoelace-style/shoelace](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shoelace-style/shoelace)
